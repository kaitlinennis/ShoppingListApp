# Shopping List Android App

This project is an Android application that allows users to create an account, log in,\
view their shopping lists, view shopping list details, and manage/edit/delete/add to their\
shopping list. I also implemented a feature that allowed users to invite others to\
view, manage, and add to their shopping lists. I also utilized Firestore to structure, organize\
and store the sets of data needed for this app, such as users, lists, and list items.

I enjoyed working on this application a lot and I thought it was a fun challenge.\
While I had points that I got stuck, such as figuring out how I was going to succesfully implement\
the invite feature that would work between various users, this project taught me a lot about\
working with and organizing sets of data in an application and breaking down a seemingly-huge\
application into smaller steps and features.

Tools used include: Android Studio (Java), Google Firebase & Firestore
